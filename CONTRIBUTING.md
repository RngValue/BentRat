<h1>Contributing to BentRat</h1>
<p>Your input is valuable. (I am 100% not manipulating you into trusting me)</p>
<p>We (by "We" I mean "I") care about all your:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bug reports</li>
  <li>Feature proposals</li>
  <li>And contributions</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>This is a free and safe space. Simply:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fork the <code>main</code> branch</li>
  <li>Make changes</li>
  <li>Open a pull request</li>
  <li>And wait for feedback. Sometimes we might merge your additions into the <code>main</code> branch without questions</li>
</ol>

<h2>Following Code Patterns</h2>
<p>Follow these rules and you should be ok:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Due to my own error, indentations are 4 spaces long</li>
  <li>Nesting if statements more than 3 times is a crime and you should be ashamed<br><sub>(be happy that BentRat's written in Rust. If it were written in C++, 4 or more indentations ANYWHERE would be banned)</sub></li>
  <li>The use of comments is optional, but be sure to use comments to justify your complicated implementations</li>
  <li>Declare variables where they make the most sense. We don't declare variables in loops</li>
</ul>
